HOW TO 1
PL: Jess Wolff
Proposal

- What problem does your app solve?
Have a life hack? Share it on how-to. Posts with the most likes / reviews will be at the top of the feed, simplifying life for everyone.

- Be as specific as possible; how does your app solve the problem?
- What is the mission statement?
A clean, and simple solution to finding answers to questions you never knew you needed.

Innovate, Admire & Explore.
Features

- What features are required for your minimum viable product?
- What features may you wish to put in a future release?
- What do the top 3 similar apps do for their users?
Frameworks - Libraries

- What 3rd party frameworks/libraries are you considering using?
JSON Web Tokens(Authentication), axios, axioswauth, bcrypt, jest, knex, helmet, cors, create-react-app, context api, react-strap, bootstrap, formik, express, sqllite
Target Audience

- Who is your target audience? Be specific.
People motivated to learn, type-A personalities. Less than 65 years old.

Research

- Research thoroughly before writing a single line of code. Solidify the features of your app conceptually before implementation.
Prototype Key Feature(s)

- This is the “bread and butter” of the app, this is what makes your app yours. Calculate how long it takes to implement these features and triple the time estimated. That way you’ll have plenty of time to finish. It is preferred to drop features and spend more time working on your MVP features if needed.
